# Collegerama offline viewer

## Info

Collegerama lacks a 'watch this video offline' button. This project downloads the lecture and its slides and watch it in your browser.
Collegerama offline viewer is a redesign of the repo [MartijnDwars/collegerama](https://github.com/MartijnDwars/collegerama) and uses a lot of code from that project.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/djosh34/collegeramaOfflineViewer.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`


## Usage

this project is still a work in progress, so a lot of the explination will come later.
